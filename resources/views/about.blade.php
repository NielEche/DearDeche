                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK"> a Gen Z Creative from Port Harcourt,
                        Nigeria. I grew up in a rather strict religious African home and found a way to escape my not so
                        pleasant reality through my imagination. From thinking up stories every night before bed(lol) to
                        penning down these stories, and dipping my hands into a range of different mediums including
                        photography, fashion design and eventually crafts, I‚Äôve managed to create a safe bubble for
                        myself doing the things I love.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK"> Dear Deche enunciated as /deeuh- day-che/
                        is the all encompassing body for the creative things I love to do, which includes mostly fashion
                        and home decor.
                        I hand make each piece one at a time, with love and care and when necessary I work with other
                        wonderfully talented local artisans.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK"> I draw inspiration from my surrounding and my femininity which are recurring themes in my work. I value slowness(pace), art, sustainability and sharing my story. 
                        My hope is that you can somehow relate to my work and it brings you a lot of happiness. 
                        Thank you for your support üêù</p>
