                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK">It is imperative that DearDeche upholds
                        sustainable business practices and we encourage consumers and creatives to contact Dear Deche
                        with any suggestions or recommendations for how Dear Deche sustainable practices might be
                        improved.</p>
                    <h3 class="pt-1 MAK">PACKAGING </h3>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK">The packaging used by DearDeche is
                        degradable and/or recyclable where possible.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Earring display cards and business cards are made from cardboard paper and can be reused
                        </li>
                        <li>- The boxes used to package Deardeche products are made from Kraft paper and can be reused.
                        </li>
                        <li>- Bubble wraps primarily used for packaging earrings and other pieces can be recycled and used
                            to create art, keep food cold, insulate windows, relive stress, etc. </li>
                        <li>- The vibrant colored tissue paper that comes with your orders can be reused and repurposed.
                            Some ideas might include; tissue paper flowers, protective cushioning for a gift, a tissue
                            paper lantern.</li>
                        <li>- The shredded paper that comes in your packages can be repurposed for packaging, pet bedding,
                            papier mache for your art projects, seedling pots, stuffings for dolls, scarecrows if you
                            have a farm, etc</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="pt-1 MAK">MATERIALS</h3>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK">Dear Deche products (earrings, ashtrays,
                        fridge magnets, jewelry boxes) are essentially made from two types clay; air dry clay which is
                        eco-friendly and polymer clay that is basically composed of polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and
                        liquid plasticiser. Although polymer clay is a plastic product, we hope that Dear Deche products
                        have long lives in your homes and are regifted or taken to second-hand stores rather than being
                        discarded. </p>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK">We have also taken steps to ensure that
                        we use air dry/polymer clay in the most sustainable manner possible.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- All damaged products that are returned to Dear Deche will be incorporated into new pieces.
                        </li>
                        <li>- No clay goes to waste during the earring making process and all clay scraps are saved to
                            create new colours or designs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-weight:lighter !important;" class="f-14 MAK">Dear Deche sources clay, metals and
                        crafting supplies from both Nigerian and foreign suppliers.</p>
